# HHUCompetitiveProgramming

At my University we have the module _Competitive Programming_. At the end of each lecture we have a contest in teams of three or an assignments (homework). These are my/our teams solutions in the past contests and assignments of the summer semester 23 (B) and the winter semester 22 (A).

I also added some prep for the North West European Regional Contest (NWERC) 2023.
